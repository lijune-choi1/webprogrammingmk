<!--Choose a letter from the alphabet (excluding I, L, and T), and design more than 5 distinct variations of that letter using only HTML and CSS.

Based on CSS properties covered in the previous lectures, 
think about how to use CSS to create complex shapes. 
Focus on carefully constructing HTML elements, as 
the nesting structure can help group each stroke and shape the letterform.
Consider how geometric forms and their variations can be 
applied to the letter. Explore the use of color, shadows, 
nd transparency to highlight both the positive and negative 
spaces within your designs.
Upload your html files to your GitHub repository, and add 
links to the pages on the GitHub homepage. Post the links in Slack with 
the channel #(yourname).-->
