        <p>In The Web We Lost (2012), Anil Dash writes: &rdquo;	In the early days of the social web, there was a
            broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own
            websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity.&ldquo;	
            In February 2015 the online journal QUARTZ published an article with the provocative
            headline: <a href = "https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet">Millions of Facebook</a>a users have no idea they're using the internet. As the article
            states: &rdquo;	This is more than a matter of semantics. The expectations and behaviors of the next
            billion people to come online will have profound effects on how the internet evolves.&ldquo;	
            In October 2014 the online journal GIZMODO published an article heralding <a href = "https://gizmodo.com/the-great-web-1-0-revival-1651487835">The Great Web 1.0
            Revival</a>. Its author Kyle Chayka observed:
            The booming size of today's mainstream social networks and the constant level of noise we
            have to deal with has inspired a sudden return to a time when the internet was quieter, safer,
            and more intimate... We're nostalgic for the close-knit, DIY nature of the early web, where
            everything was smaller...
            The DIY aesthetics and practices of the mid-1990s have been embraced by the anti-social
            network <a href = "https://tilde.club/">TILDE.CLUB</a>, which hosts a small community of users on a single unix computer. For
            some, TILDE.CLUB serves as a platform for revisiting amateur web aesthetics in a
            contemporary context. For example, on her page, Olia Lialina invites users to view a new net art
            work 640x480 - a 4-tab browser installation. For many others however, TILDE.CLUB has served
            as little more than a hip territory to occupy. Many pages remain blank.</p>

        <p>In other corners of the internet, Web 1.0 aesthetics have never disappeared. <a href = "https://luckysoap.com/">My own website</a>,
            including this page, which uses fixed-width table cells, is based on a template I created in
            HomeSite in 1997.
            Web 1.0 aesthetics persist in source code and stated objectives of the massive <a href = "https://www.ubuweb.com/">Ubu Web site</a>,
            an &rdquo;	independent resource dedicated to all strains of the avant-garde, ethnopoetics, and outsider
            arts.&ldquo;	 On 16 December 2014, the founder of <a href = "https://x.com/ubuweb/status/545074372093165568">boasted on Twitter</a> that "the whole damn site is still
            hand-coded in html 1.0 in bbedit, from templates made in 1996."
            I shall put off updating my website templates until out-of-date design is no longer cool.</p>
        <h3 class = "line">I evoke the term &rsquo;handmade web&lsquo;	 in order to draw attention both to the manual labour
            involved in the composition of web pages, and the functioning of the web page itself as a
            &rsquo;manual&lsquo;	, a &rsquo;handbook&lsquo;	, a set of instructions required for a computer program to run.</h3>
