            <p>For most of its history web pages have been read on desktop or laptop computers. Readers
                have had the option of right-clicking on any page, selecting View Page Source, copying, pasting,
                and re-writing the source code. In this manner, readers become writers.
                In February 2015, Matthew Rothberg created a website called <a href = "https://github.com/mroth/unindexed">Unindexed</a> which continuously
                searched Google for itself. It survived for 22 days before being indexed, at which point it was
                permanently deleted. Rothberg has since shared the <a href = "https://github.com/mroth/unindexed">source code on GitHub</a>, so you too can
                create a website which self-destructs the moment Google indexes it.
                Dozens of readers have re-written the source code of Nick Montfort&rsquo;s <a href = "https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/">Taroko Gorge (2008)</a>. For
                many, this was their first experience &lsquo;making&rsquo;	 a computer-generated text.
                I have rewritten Taroko Gorge three times. Further to the close relation between the handmade
                web and ephemeral print materials, excerpts of output and source code from the first
                iteration, <a href = "https://luckysoap.com/generations/gorge.html">Gorge (2010)</a>, were published in my very small press print
                book <a href = "https://luckysoap.com/generations/generations.html">GENERATION[S] (2010)</a>, which, I believe, is now only available as a PDF. 
                <a href = "https://luckysoap.com/generations/gorge.html">Gorge</a> is a
                never-ending tract of computer-generated text spewing verse approximations, poetic paroxysms
                on food, consumption, decadence, and desire.</p>
            <h3 class = "line">I evoke the term &rsquo;	handmade web&rsquo;	 in order to draw attention to the physical body.</h3>
            <p>Consider the manual labour carried out by the mouse hand in Daniel Eatock&rsquo;s <a href = "https://www.onemilescroll.com/">The One Mile
                Scroll (2008)</a> A few entries appear at the top of the screen - Denver, The Mile High City - my
                grandfather's grave, Denver - after that we scroll and scroll. The hand is made to work. Through
                the labour of the body the virtual space of the browser window is transformed into an actual,
                physical distance.
                Ironically, handheld devices have distanced us from the handmade web. <a href = "https://theliteraryplatform.com/news/2014/08/from-the-digital-to-the-bookbound/">
                In Reading Writing </a>
                Interfaces: From the Digital to the Bookbound (2014), Lori Emerson argues: &rdquo;	The iPad works
                because users can't know how it works&ldquo;	 (15). Reading the web on an iPhone, iPad, or similar
                device, readers do not have the option of viewing the page source. The iPad provides
                consumers with access to materials created by others, but cannot easily be used as a tool in the
                handcrafting of new materials.</p>
            <h3 class = "line">I evoke the term &rsquo;	handmade web&rsquo;	 to suggest slowness and smallness as a forms of
                resistance.</h3>
            <p>In today&rsquo;s highly commercialised web of multinational corporations, proprietary applications,
                read-only devices, search algorithms, Content Management Systems, WYSIWYG editors, and
                digital publishers it becomes an increasingly radical act to hand-code and self-publish
                experimental web art and writing projects.
                The more proprietary, predatory, and puerile a place the web becomes, the more committed I
                am to using it in poetic and intransigent ways.</p>
